Install and run the CSET cylc workflow
======================================

.. Tutorial on running CSET via its cylc workflow.
.. TODO: Images need updating to match the tutorial data.

This tutorial provides a step by step guide of how to run CSET via its included
cylc workflow comparing data from multiple forecasts, resulting in a website of
plots to navigate.

Prerequisites
-------------

The CSET workflow uses **cylc 8**, so you must ensure that is the version of
cylc configured for use on your system. You can check whether cylc is available
with the following command:

.. caution::

    The example shell snippets in this documentation use ``bash``, and may not
    work with other shells. In particular there are known issues activating
    conda environments with ``ksh``.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Check version starts in 8.
    cylc --version

Install the command line
------------------------

The CSET cylc workflow is included with the CSET command line program.
Therefore, the first thing you will need to do is to install the CSET command
line.

The recommended way to install CSET is via conda_. It is packaged on
`conda-forge`_ in the ``cset`` package. The following command will install CSET
into its own conda environment, which is recommended to avoid possible package
conflicts.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create --name=cset --channel=conda-forge cset

To use CSET, you need to activate the conda environment with the ``conda
activate`` command.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate cset

.. note::

    You will need to rerun the ``conda activate cset`` command whenever you use
    a new terminal.

Once that is completed, CSET should be ready to use. This can be verified by running
a simple command.

.. code-block:: bash

    cset --version

This command should output the installed version of CSET. This will look
something like ``CSET vX.Y.Z``.

Install the workflow
--------------------

With the newly created conda environment activated, run the ``cset
extract-workflow`` command to unpack the workflow from inside the CSET package
into a directory of your choosing. A sensible choice is ``~/cylc-src``, which is
the default location where cylc will search for workflows.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Create the cylc-src directory if it doesn't exist.
    mkdir -p ~/cylc-src
    # Extract the workflow from CSET into the chosen directory.
    cset extract-workflow ~/cylc-src
    # Change into the freshly unpacked workflow directory.
    cd ~/cylc-src/cset-workflow-vX.Y.Z

Your directory should look like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ls
    app  conda-environment  includes                     lib   opt        rose-suite.conf.example
    bin  flow.cylc          install_restricted_files.sh  meta  README.md  site

If you are at a site with specific CSET integration, such as the Met Office or
Momentum Partnership, you will want to install the site specific configuration
files that specify where cylc will run the tasks. This is done by running the
``install_restricted_files.sh`` script. For other users, you can skip this step
and use the ``localhost`` site instead.

.. code-block:: bash

    ./install_restricted_files.sh

You have now installed the CSET workflow and are ready to use it.

Download sample data
--------------------

We will now download some sample data containing screen level air temperature
and air temperature on pressure levels for two sample forecasts, for two
different models to help us explore some of the functionality of CSET. The
tutorial data consists of 4 files to download:

=========================== =======
File                        Size
=========================== =======
`MODELA_20230117T0000Z.nc`_ ~20 MiB
`MODELA_20230118T0000Z.nc`_ ~20 MiB
`MODELB_20230117T0000Z.nc`_ ~90 MiB
`MODELB_20230118T0000Z.nc`_ ~90 MiB
=========================== =======

Download these files and save them somewhere persistent, such as your home
directory or a SCRATCH disk. You can download via your browser or directly copy
these links and use ``wget`` to retrieve on the command line.

Workflow configuration
----------------------

After downloading the CSET release and the data to evaluate, we next set up the
required CSET configuration. Take a copy of the ``rose-suite.conf.example`` configuration
file to create a copy ``rose-suite.conf`` in the same directory. This can be edited
from inside the ``cset-workflow-vX.Y.Z`` directory using the ``rose edit``
command.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Copy the example file to create a fresh rose-suite.conf.
    cp rose-suite.conf.example rose-suite.conf
    # Edit the configuration with the rose edit GUI.
    rose edit

You should now have a graphical program with which you can navigate the various
configuration settings that CSET provides. Detailed help for each setting can be
accessed by clicking the setting's name.

General setup options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Expand the top level ``suite conf`` heading of the navigation tree to the left
hand side of the GUI, go to the ``General setup options`` panel, and set the
following settings:

* Select the ``Site`` or set ``Localhost`` if not listed.

* Adjust the ``Web directory`` to point to a directory that is served by your
  webserver. Often this is a directory like ``~/public_html``.

* (Optionally) set the ``Website Address`` to the URL where your web directory
  is served. This is the address your will use to display your results in a webbrowser.

.. hint::

    ``rose edit`` is somewhat unreliable. Frequently click the ``save`` button
    to avoid losing entered information when navigating to a new page.

Cycling and Model options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next select the ``Cycling and Model options`` panel in the left hand navigation
tree, and set the following:

* Leave the ``Cycling mode`` selected as ``Case Study``.

* Add the two required ``Case study dates`` to evaluate. The example data for
  this tutorial has two forecasts initialised on ``"20230117T0000Z"`` and
  ``"20230118T0000Z"``.

* Set the ``Analysis length`` as ``PT48H`` to indicate a 48-hour forecast
  length.

* Set the ``Number of models`` to 2, as we want to assess two different models.

* Keep ``Cutout Subarea`` set to ``False``.

.. image:: cset_uiA.png
    :alt: Screenshot of the CSET GUI for Cycling and Model options.

Setting the number of models activates new ``Model 01``, ``Model 02``, ...
panels in the navigation tree in which to specify model-relevant settings. You
may need to further expand the navigation tree to see them.

Navigate to each Model panel by expanding the Cycling and Model options menu in
turn to set model-specific settings:

* Add a readable ``Model name`` which will be associated with the data in CSET
  outputs.

* Select ``Filesystem`` as the ``Data source`` to indicate that the test data is
  on a locally mounted disk.

* Enter the path to data, including wildcards and formatting to specify filename
  structure. This should follow the format
  ``/some/path/to/data/MODELA_%Y%m%dT%H%MZ.nc``, providing a unique path to the
  data files. The ``%`` components in the file path will evaluate the filename
  based on the case study date.

Diagnostic options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next expand the ``Diagnostic options`` panel and open the ``Surface (2D)
fields`` panel.

This panel provides option for processing and visualising variables that are
only defined on a single diagnostic level such as, but not exclusively, surface
fields. Set the following settings:

* Click the ``+`` option to add a variable name to ``Surface (2D) fields`` and
  add ``"temperature_at_screen_level"``. This setting lists all 2D variables of
  interest from the input data that CSET will process.

* Set ``SPATIAL_SURFACE_FIELD`` to ``True`` to enable plotting of spatial maps.

* Set ``SPATIAL_SURFACE_FIELD_METHOD`` to ``"SEQ"`` and ``"MEAN"``. These are
  the aggregation methods used by the spatial plotting. The ``SEQ`` method will
  produce a series of output maps for every time through the forecast (typically
  hourly), while the ``MEAN`` method will produce spatial plots meaned over
  forecast period. Multiple methods can be specified in this list to generate
  all within the same CSET workflow run.

* Set the first, second, and fourth ``SPATIAL_SURFACE_FIELD_AGGREGATION``
  options. This sets the methods for generating aggregated summary maps across
  case studies computed as a function of lead time, hour of day, validity time,
  or to generate a single map summarising all input data across all forecast
  periods.

* Set ``SPATIAL_DIFFERENCE_SURFACE_FIELD`` to ``True`` to enable plotting of
  difference map plots comparing the two models.

* Set the first, second, and fourth
  ``SPATIAL_DIFFERENCE_SURFACE_FIELD_AGGREGATION`` options, enabling aggregated
  differences across multiple cases.

* Set ``TIMESERIES_SURFACE_FIELD`` to ``True`` to enable domain mean (or
  sub-area) time series plots.

* Set the first, second, and fourth ``TIMESERIES_SURFACE_FIELD_AGGREGATION``
  options, enabling time series across multiple cases.

* Set ``HISTOGRAM_SURFACE_FIELD`` to enable plotting of histograms.

* Set the first, second, and fourth ``HISTOGRAM_SURFACE_FIELD_AGGREGATION``
  options to control plotting of aggregated outputs across forecasts.

Next, to add a 3D variable of interest, open the ``Pressure level fields``
panel. Standard options for variables defined on multiple levels (e.g. pressure
levels or vertical model levels) are similar, and editable on the relevant
sub-panel selected from the left hand navigation tree. Set the following:

* Add ``"zonal_wind_at_pressure_levels"`` to the list of ``Pressure level
  fields``.

* Add ``200``, ``500``, and ``850`` to the list of ``PRESSURE_LEVELS``, the
  pressure levels on which to generate outputs.

* Set ``SPATIAL_PLEVEL_FIELD`` to ``True`` to enable spatial plots on each
  selected pressure level.

* Set ``SPATIAL_DIFFERENCE_PLEVEL_FIELD`` to ``True`` to enable plotting of
  spatial differences.

* Set ``PROFILE_PLEVEL`` to enable vertical profile plots of the domain mean.
  This will only generate profiles from the ``PRESSURE_LEVELS`` selected (i.e.
  data at 200 hPa, 500 hPa and 850 hPa in this example), so ensure the number of
  requested levels is sufficiently high to generate the required vertical
  resolution outputs.

* Set the first, second, and fourth ``PROFILE_PLEVEL_AGGREGATION`` options.

Ensure you save the configuration before closing ``rose edit``. Once saved, you
can validate your configuration with ``cylc validate`` to check for missed
settings or unexpected values.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Perform some quick checks to make sure the metadata is valid.
    cylc validate .

Run the workflow
----------------

After configuration via the rose GUI, the CSET workflow is ready to run.

To run the workflow, use ``cylc vip`` within the ``cset-workflow-vX.Y.Z``
directory. You can view the job's progress in the browser with the cylc GUI,
accessible with the command ``cylc gui``, or in the terminal with ``cylc tui``.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Run workflow from within the cset-workflow-vX.Y.Z directory.
    cylc vip .
    # Monitor the workflow's progress.
    cylc gui

Other commands to control the workflow are described in the `cylc running
workflows`_ documentation.

Once CSET has finished running you will receive an email containing a link to
the output page.

View CSET outputs
-----------------

Once completed, the CSET workflow will send an email to confirm successful
completion and link to outputs at the web address specified in the GUI.

Outputs are stored in the ``web`` directory, located in
``~/cylc-run/cset-workflow-vX.Y.Z/runN/share/web`` (or an equivalent
``cylc-run`` path if running the CSET workflow with a specified run name).

.. warning::

    If you ``cylc clean`` the workflow, this will delete the plot directory. To
    keep the plots independently of the workflow directory, move the web
    directory to a required alternative location and update the symlink to the
    ``web`` directory back to the ``Web directory`` location from which CSET
    outputs are displayed.

.. image:: cset_web1.png
    :alt: Screenshot of the CSET web interface showing the landing page with workflow status information.

CSET web outputs can be navigated using the sidebar organised by type of plot,
and by forecast date and aggregations. Plots can be displayed in either
left-hand, central, or right-hand web views.

You have now run the CSET workflow! Take some time to explore the output
webpage. You can find further information on configuring the workflow in
:doc:`/usage/workflow-configure`.
