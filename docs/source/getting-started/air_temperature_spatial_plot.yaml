# Sequence of steps to run.
steps:
  # Specify the operator to run in each step.
  - operator: read.read_cubes
    # Specify the name of the argument, and its value.
    file_paths: "/data/*.nc"

  - operator: filters.filter_cubes
    # Can specify extra keyword arguments as sub-maps.
    constraint:
      operator: constraints.combine_constraints
      var_constraint:
        # Can nest in another operator to use its output as an argument,
        # multiple levels deep if needed.
        operator: constraints.generate_var_constraint
        # Input implicitly taken from the previous step, but can be overridden
        # by using the appropriate keyword argument.
        varname: m01s03i236
      cell_method_constraint:
        operator: constraints.generate_cell_methods_constraint
        # Values can be more than just strings, such as this empty list.
        cell_methods: []

  # Save a sequence of plots, one per time.
  - operator: plot.spatial_pcolormesh_plot

  # Save a single cube with all the processed data.
  - operator: write.write_cube_to_nc
