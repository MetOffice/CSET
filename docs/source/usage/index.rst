Installation
------------

Currently CSET is not packaged. The way to use it is thus via an editable
install.

First make sure you have installed and activated the conda environment.

.. code-block::

    conda create -n cset-dev --file requirements/locks/py310-lock-linux-64.txt
    conda activate cset-dev

Then, from the root of the repository, CSET can be installed with :code:`pip install
-e .`

Usage
-----

page.
