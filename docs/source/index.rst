CSET (Convective- and turbulence-scale Evaluation and verification Toolkit) is
an open-source toolkit for evaluation, verification and investigation of
convective- and turbulence-scale numerical models for weather and climate
applications, cutting across time and space scales with a focus on regional
domains.

CSET provides a centralised and peer-reviewed source of tools to aid
process-oriented evaluation for UM and LFRic models, supporting both
deterministic and ensemble configurations.

In the future, it will support evaluation of machine learning models and utilise
observations from a range of sources to aid in the evaluation process. It will
utilise the Model Evaluation Tools (MET) software to provide a range of
verification metrics aligned with operational verification best practices.

For CSET model and diagnostics developers, CSET offers well documented and peer
reviewed evaluation tools with a well defined release cycle and flexible
evaluation code that can adapt to user needs. CSET is built with portability in
mind and can be run on a range of platforms from local desktops to HPC systems
and cloud servers. It ensures traceable and reproducible results during the
regional model assessment cycle and offers diagnostics access to observations
and a legacy through continued maintenance and improved discoverability.

It aligns parametrisation development, diagnostic development and evaluation
research, feeding back into Regional Atmosphere and Land (RAL) model development
across the Met Office and Momentum® Partnership.

It is built using a modern software stack underpinned by python 3 and METplus.
Contributions to CSET are promoted by clear documentation and working practices,
automatic testing, and an open access GitHub code base.
