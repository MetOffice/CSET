.. note::

   This is where we should write a high level introduction to CSET and have
   some useful links to other related resources.

CSET is a tool to aid in evaluating regional model configurations. It aims to
replace the collection of bespoke scripts littering people's home directories,
This centralisation of diagnostics should also make evaluations more consistent
and comparable

Development takes place on GitHub, for now in a private repository, though there
are plans to openly licence some, perhaps most, of the code.
