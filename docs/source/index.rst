CSET (Convective- and turbulence-scale Evaluation and verification Toolkit) is
an open-source toolkit for evaluation, verification and investigation of
convective- and turbulence-scale numerical models for weather and climate
applications, cutting across time and space scales with a focus on regional
domains.

CSET provides a centralised and peer-reviewed source of tools to aid
process-oriented evaluation for UM and LFRic models, supporting both
deterministic and ensemble configurations. It will support evaluation of machine
learning models and utilise observations from a range of sources to aid in the
evaluation process.

It will utilise the Model Evaluation Tools (MET) software to provide a range of
verification metrics aligned with operational verification best practices.

For model and diagnostics developers CSET offers well documented and peer
reviewed evaluation tools with a well defined release cycle and flexible
evaluation code that can adapt to users needs. CSET is built with portability in
mind and can be run on a range of platforms from local desktops to HPC systems
and AWS servers. It ensures traceable and reproduceable results during the model
assessment cycle and offers a legacy for diagnostics and access to observations.

It aligns parametrisation development, diagnostic development and evaluation
research, feeding back into Regional Atmosphere and Land (RAL) model development
across the Met Office and Momentum® Partnership.

It is build on a modern software stack using python 3 and METplus. Clear
documentation, working practices, automatic testing, and open access promote
contributions.
