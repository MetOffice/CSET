:abbr:`CSET (Acronym meaning contested)` is a tool to aid in verifying and
evaluating :abbr:`ESM (Earth System Model)` configurations. It aims to replace
the :abbr:`RES (Regional Evaluation Suite)`, :abbr:`RMED (Regional Model
Evaluation & Development)` Toolbox and the collections of bespoke scripts
littering people's home directories, reducing effort wasted on duplicating
already existing code. This centralisation of diagnostics should also make
evaluations more consistent, reproducible and comparable. For more, see
:doc:`/background/why-cset`
