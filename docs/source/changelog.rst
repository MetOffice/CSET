24.6.0 (2024-06-17)
-------------------

This release contains a quite a number of small improvements, increasing the
reliability of CSET significantly, and paving the way for further improvements
to come.

* `@jfrost-mo`_ replaced how the encoding of subprocess output is determined in
  :pr:`604`. This adds support for python before 3.11, and more accurately
  reflects the encoding.
* `@jwarner8`_ add intelligent determination of whether to plot country lines in
  :pr:`655`
* `@daflack`_ fixed inflow properties recipe in :pr:`662`
* `@daflack`_ added science review guidance to the documentation in :pr:`649`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ ensured cartopy data files are included in the GitHub Actions
  cache in :pr:`647`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ improved the error message for missing data files in :pr:`663`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ grouped the package install logs in GitHub Actions in :pr:`645`
* `@daflack`_ added an inflow layer properties diagnostic in :pr:`353`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ fixed LFRic cube metadata on load in :pr:`627`. This means that
  loading LFRic data no longer requires special steps in the recipe.
* `@jfrost-mo`_ made the ``install_restricted_files.sh`` script non-interactive
  in :pr:`606`. This should make it less confusing to use.
* `@Sylviabohnenstengel`_ added information to rose-meta for colorbar selection
  and provided path to example JSON file in :pr:`632`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ added a Generative AI policy in :pr:`624`

* `@jwarner8`_ use common operator to identify x/y coord names in regrid
  operator :pr:`626`
* `@jwarner8`_ added generic cube util for common functions so all operators can
  use to reduce repetition in :pr:`620`
* `@JorgeBornemann`_ added METPlus GridStat functionality (NIWA) in :pr:`629`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ added a code of conduct in :pr:`618`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ fixed some rose edit metadata so the subarea selectors show up
  when enabled in :pr:`612`

  makes it easier to see if configuration mistakes were made.
* `@jfrost-mo`_ improved the documentation for adding a new diagnostic in
  :pr:`603`
* `@dasha-shchep`_ added ``generate_area_constraint`` operator and added to
  LFRic recipes in :pr:`522`. This was their first contribution 🎉
* `@Sylviabohnenstengel`_ added a vertical line plotting operator that plots
  vertical profiles using an optional series coordinate and an optional sequence
  coordinate in :pr:`567`. The series coordinate is currently tested for
  pressure and the sequence coordinate allows displaying vertical profiles over
  time using the time slider functionality. Furthermore added a recipe to plot
  vertical profiles and test functions for the vertical plot operator.
* `@jfrost-mo`_ dropped python 3.9 support in :pr:`448` The minimum required
  python is now 3.10.
* `@jfrost-mo`_ fixed some outdated documentation examples in :pr:`546`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ added setuptools as an explicit dependency of the workflow in
  :pr:`543`
* `@cjohnson-pi`_ added support for custom plotting styles in :pr:`570`. This
  avoids many issues of side-by-side plots having different scales, or extreme
  values causing plots to saturate.
* `@Sylviabohnenstengel`_ documentation: removed necessity to add new recipe to flow.cylc.
* `@Ashfinn`_ fixed a typo in the documentation in :pr:`573`. This was their
  first contribution 🎉
* `@jfrost-mo`_ fixed how arguments from the ``CSET_ADDOPTS`` environment
  variable are parsed in :pr:`569`. This fixes issues with passing lists into
  recipes.

* `@Sylviabohnenstengel`_ documented the common error of operating on a CubeList
  instead of a Cube in :pr:`541`
* `@Sylviabohnenstengel`_ documented how to update your conda environment in
  :pr:`519`
* `@Sylviabohnenstengel`_ documented the common error of no cubes being loaded
  in :pr:`513`
* `@Sylviabohnenstengel`_ and `@jfrost-mo`_ redid the rose-meta sort orders so
  that workflow configuration makes more sense in :pr:`504`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ updated the example rose-suite.conf to reflect what a modern
  version should look like in :pr:`508`

------------------

This release contains some major changes to the user experience. This includes
many of the CLI commands changing names, and the :doc:`/index` being completely
restructured. Hopefully this should be the last major reshuffle of the user
experience, as we are getting closers to being feature complete for our MVP.

0.1.0 (2023-04-24)
------------------

The first release of CSET! 🎉 This release contains basic operators to do
reading, writing, filtering, and plotting of data. It is however still quite
limited in each of them, and still doesn't promise much in the way of API
stability, with things undoubtedly going to undergo significant change in the
near future.

This release also serves as a basis for packaging CSET out into the wider world;
packages will be released on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/CSET/>`_, and
`conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cset>`_.

* Re-enable testing on python 3.11 by `@jfrost-mo`_ in :pr:`61`
