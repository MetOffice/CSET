25.3.0 (2025-03-06)
-------------------

This release is the baseline for evaluating **RAL3_LFRic#708.1** with RMED
Ticket #708 detailing the science configuration. It introduces a fixed
evaluation functionality for RAL3-LFRic and RAL3-UM, new functionality, bug
fixes, and improvements. Key features for RAL3-LFRic evaluation include:

* Surface fields: spatial plots, timeseries, histograms, model comparison plots,
  time aggregation by hour of day, validity time, forecast range, area averages.
* Pressure level fields: spatial plots, timeseries, histograms, model
  comparison plots, time aggregation by hour of day, validity time, forecast
  range, area averages, vertical profiles, PDFs.

Additional capabilities: transects, point selection, QQ plots, age of air
diagnostics, cape diagnostics that can be selected by the user.

The next release will add analysis on model levels, multi-line plotting, and
more derived variables.

* `@jfrost-mo`_ grouped the package install logs in GitHub Actions in :pr:`645`
* `@daflack`_ added an inflow layer properties diagnostic in :pr:`353`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ fixed LFRic cube metadata on load in :pr:`627`. This means that
  loading LFRic data no longer requires special steps in the recipe.
* `@jfrost-mo`_ made the ``install_restricted_files.sh`` script non-interactive
  in :pr:`606`. This should make it less confusing to use.
* `@Sylviabohnenstengel`_ added information to rose-meta for colorbar selection
  and provided path to example JSON file in :pr:`632`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ added a Generative AI policy in :pr:`624`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ linked to the `CSET discussion forum`_ in :pr:`625`
* `@jwarner8`_ use common operator to identify x/y coord names in regrid
  operator :pr:`626`

  use to reduce repetition in :pr:`620`

  makes it easier to see if configuration mistakes were made.
* `@jfrost-mo`_ improved the documentation for adding a new diagnostic in
  :pr:`603`
* `@dasha-shchep`_ added ``generate_area_constraint`` operator and added to
  LFRic recipes in :pr:`522`. This was their first contribution 🎉
* `@Sylviabohnenstengel`_ added a vertical line plotting operator that plots
  vertical profiles using an optional series coordinate and an optional sequence
  coordinate in :pr:`567`. The series coordinate is currently tested for
  pressure and the sequence coordinate allows displaying vertical profiles over
  time using the time slider functionality. Furthermore added a recipe to plot
  vertical profiles and test functions for the vertical plot operator.
* `@jfrost-mo`_ dropped python 3.9 support in :pr:`448` The minimum required
  python is now 3.10.
* `@jfrost-mo`_ fixed some outdated documentation examples in :pr:`546`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ added setuptools as an explicit dependency of the workflow in
  :pr:`543`

  avoids many issues of side-by-side plots having different scales, or extreme
  values causing plots to saturate.
* `@Sylviabohnenstengel`_ documentation: removed necessity to add new recipe to flow.cylc.
* `@Ashfinn`_ fixed a typo in the documentation in :pr:`573`. This was their
  first contribution 🎉
* `@jfrost-mo`_ fixed how arguments from the ``CSET_ADDOPTS`` environment
  variable are parsed in :pr:`569`. This fixes issues with passing lists into
  recipes.

* `@Sylviabohnenstengel`_ documented the common error of operating on a CubeList
  instead of a Cube in :pr:`541`

  :pr:`519`
* `@Sylviabohnenstengel`_ documented the common error of no cubes being loaded
  in :pr:`513`
* `@Sylviabohnenstengel`_ and `@jfrost-mo`_ redid the rose-meta sort orders so
  that workflow configuration makes more sense in :pr:`504`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ updated the example rose-suite.conf to reflect what a modern
  version should look like in :pr:`508`

------------------

This release contains some major changes to the user experience. This includes
many of the CLI commands changing names, and the :doc:`/index` being completely

experience, as we are getting closers to being feature complete for our MVP.

dumping the built in recipes to disk.

0.1.0 (2023-04-24)
------------------

The first release of CSET! 🎉 This release contains basic operators to do
reading, writing, filtering, and plotting of data. It is however still quite
limited in each of them, and still doesn't promise much in the way of API
stability, with things undoubtedly going to undergo significant change in the
near future.

This release also serves as a basis for packaging CSET out into the wider world;
packages will be released on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/CSET/>`_, and
`conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cset>`_.

* Re-enable testing on python 3.11 by `@jfrost-mo`_ in :pr:`61`
