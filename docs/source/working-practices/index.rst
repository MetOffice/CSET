Working Practices
=================

To aid in the development of CSET we are adopting some working practices,
detailed on the following pages:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    pull-requests
    git
    testing
    documentation
    code-review
    releases
    backwards-compatibility

Contributing
------------

Contributions are readily welcome! In addition to reading the working practices
linked above, the key recommendation is early communication. Open an `issue on
Github`_ with your proposed change or addition in the design phase, and then
other can provide guidance early, instead of possibly rejecting work at the
review stage after you have spent weeks working on it.
