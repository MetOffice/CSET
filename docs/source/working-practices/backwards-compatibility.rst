Backwards Compatibility Policy
==============================

As soon as we have users for CSET maintaining a certain level of backwards
compatibility becomes important, as they will want their use of CSET to continue
to work in future. As such it is useful to define a backwards compatibility
policy that sets expectations about the way backwards incompatible (AKA
"breaking") changes are made.

Some things to consider:

* How quickly backwards incompatible changes can be made.
* How long depreciation periods should be for different sizes of change.
* How the changes will be communicated with users.
* Guidance on avoiding making backwards incompatible changes where possible.
