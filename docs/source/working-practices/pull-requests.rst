Pull Requests
=============

All code changes must go through a pull request. Pushing directly to the main
branch has been disabled. Before being merged, code will have to go through
several stages of review:

The first will be the automatic tests being run by the CI system. This
automatically happens when you make a pull request against the main branch, and
is a good catcher of initial problems. Generally you should resolved any test
failures before asking for code review.
