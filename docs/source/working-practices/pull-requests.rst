Pull Requests
=============

All code changes must go through a pull request. Pushing directly to the main
branch has been disabled. Before being merged, code will have to go through
several stages of review.

The first will be the automatic tests being run by the CI system. This
automatically happens when you make a pull request against the main branch, and
is a good catcher of initial problems. Generally you should resolved any test
failures before asking for code review. The page on :doc:`testing` goes into
more detail.

The next step will be getting other people to look at your code. This involves
three reviews, covering the technical, scientific, and portability aspects of
your submission. A minor change, such as fixing a typo in the documentation,
would only require sign-off from the technical reviewer, and would be a lot
quicker. More detail is on the :doc:`code-review` page.

From the review you will probably receive feedback, and things to change and
improve. Once these points have been addressed the code will be merged into the
main branch, and become part of CSET proper.
