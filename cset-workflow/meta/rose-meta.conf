help=Full path (including file name) to the forecast data on your chosen storage

    it is automatically quoted there.

    strftime format strings are supported, and will be replaced with the
    desired case study date or trial time. E.g: `/data/%Y%m%d/model1/*.nc`

    For forecast lead time, %N can be used which is replaced by the 3 digit
    lead time in hours. The regular placeholders are still usable, and refer
    to the initiation time E.g: `/data/case_%Y%m%d/model1_%N.nc`

    Commonly useful placeholders:
    %Y: Year, e.g: 2024
    %m: Month, e.g: 12
    %d: Day, e.g: 31
    %H: Hour, e.g: 23
    %M: Minute, e.g: 59
    %N: Forecast lead time in hours, e.g: 012

    Forecast initiation time, AKA data time, is the validity time of the first
    data point. For realtime forecasts this is approximately when the forecast
    was started. Selecting this also allows templating the forecast lead time.

    Validity time is when the simulated or predicted data is valid for.
