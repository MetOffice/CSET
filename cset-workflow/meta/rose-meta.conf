description=The path to the forecast.
help=Full path (including file name) to the forecast data on your chosen storage
    system. Can contain wildcards. No quotation marks required in rose edit, as
    it is already quoted there.

    strftime format strings are supported, and will be replaced with the
    desired case study date or trial time. E.g: `/data/%Y%m%d/model1/*.nc`

    For forecast lead time, %N can be used which is replaced by the 3 digit
    lead time in hours. The regular placeholders are still usable, and refer
    to the initiation time E.g: `/data/case_%Y%m%d/model1_%N.nc`

    Commonly useful placeholders:
    %Y: Year, e.g: 2024
    %m: Month, e.g: 12
    %d: Day, e.g: 31
    %H: Hour, e.g: 23
    %M: Minute, e.g: 59
    %N: Forecast lead time in hours, e.g: 012

    Forecast initiation time, AKA data time, is the time of the validity time of
    the first data point. For realtime forecasts this is approximately when the
    forecast was started.

    Validity time is when the data is predicting for.

    Forecast lead time is how far from the forecast initiation time the data is.
