title: $MODEL_NAME aviation colour state due to cloud base spatial plot
description: |
  Generates a plot of the aviation colour state due to cloud base altitude
  The aviation colour state can be found on the [Met Office website](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/transport/aviation/regulated/national-aviation/abs/faqs). It provides a
  user oriented diagnostic to understand the impacts of cloud base on
  aviation.
