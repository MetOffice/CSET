title: $VARNAME $PLEVEL Level Histogram Plot case aggregation lead time
description: |
  Extracts and plots the probability density of $PLEVEL level $VARNAME from a
  file at model level $PLEVEL of $MODEL_NAME. It uses
  [`plt.hist`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html)
  to plot the probability density so that the area under the histogram
  integrates to 1. `stacked` is set to True so the sum of the histograms is
  normalized to 1. In case of ensemble data choose from postage stamp plot or
  single plot via the single_plot option in the recipe directly. Case
  aggregation occurs by putting all of the data into one histogram whilst still
  providing a single cube to the histogram operator.
