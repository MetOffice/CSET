title: $MODEL_NAME $VARNAME Surface Level Histogram Plot case aggregation by hour of day
description: |
  Extracts and plots the probability density of surface `$VARNAME`. It uses
  [`plt.hist`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html)
  to plot the probability density so that the area under the histogram
  integrates to 1. stacked is set to True so the sum of the histograms is
  normalized to 1. Case aggregation occurs by putting all of the data into
  one histogram whilst still providing a single cube to the histogram operator.

steps:
  - operator: read.read_cubes
    constraint:
      operator: constraints.combine_constraints
      variable_constraint:
        operator: constraints.generate_var_constraint
        varname: $VARNAME
      pressure_level_constraint:
        operator: constraints.generate_level_constraint
        coordinate: pressure
        levels: []

  - operator: aggregate.ensure_aggregatable_across_cases

  - operator: collapse.collapse_by_hour_of_day
    method: MEAN

  - operator: write.write_cube_to_nc
    overwrite: True

  - operator: plot.plot_histogram_series
