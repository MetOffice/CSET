title: "Presence of hurricane force winds at the surface\nDifference ($BASE_MODEL - $OTHER_MODEL)"
description: |
  Generates the surface wind speed converted onto the Beaufort Scale and filters
  for winds that are hurricane force or above (Force 12 or above). It takes the
  difference between two models. The Beaufort Scale can be found on the [Met Office website](https://weather.metoffice.gov.uk/guides/coast-and-sea/beaufort-scale).
