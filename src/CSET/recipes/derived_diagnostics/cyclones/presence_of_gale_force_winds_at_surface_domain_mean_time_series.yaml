title: $MODEL_NAME presence of gale force winds at the surface domain mean timeseries
description: |
  Generates the surface wind speed converted onto the Beaufort Scale and filters
  based upon whether the wind speed is gale force or above (Force 8 or above). It provides
  a timeseries representing the chance of gale force winds across the domain.
  The Beaufort Scale can be found on the [Met Office website](https://weather.metoffice.gov.uk/guides/coast-and-sea/beaufort-scale).
