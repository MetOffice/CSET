title: $MODEL_NAME presence of storm force winds at the surface spatial plot
description: |
  Generates a plot of the surface wind speed converted onto the Beaufort Scale
  and filters based on whether the winds are storm force or above (Force 10 or above).
  The Beaufort Scale can be found on the [Met Office website](https://weather.metoffice.gov.uk/guides/coast-and-sea/beaufort-scale).
