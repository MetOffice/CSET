title: "Daily maximum temperature at 0900 UTC\nDifference ($BASE_MODEL - $OTHER_MODEL)"
description: |
  Extracts and plots the daily maximum temperature between 0900 UTC and 0900 UTC
  the following day as per observation measurements and plots the difference. The maximum
  is created from a rolling 24 h window, adds hour of day coordinate, and then
  selects the 21 UTC hour from the rolling window as this represents the validity
  time of the required range. The maximum temperature can occur any time in the 24
  h window.
