title: $MODEL_NAME surface wind speed on Beaufort Scale domain mean timeseries
description: |
  Generates the surface wind speed converted onto the Beaufort Scale and provides
  a timeseries representing the average windspeed across the domain.
  The Beaufort Scale can be found on the [Met Office website](https://weather.metoffice.gov.uk/guides/coast-and-sea/beaufort-scale). It allows human-understandable names to be given to wind bins.
