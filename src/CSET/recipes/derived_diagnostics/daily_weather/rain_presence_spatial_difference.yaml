title: "Rain presence\nDifference ($BASE_MODEL - $OTHER_MODEL)"
description: |
  Generates a mask of whether rain is present in a grid box and provides a
  the difference between two models. Values will be positive or negative one
  depending on which model has rain present at that location if the other
  does not.
