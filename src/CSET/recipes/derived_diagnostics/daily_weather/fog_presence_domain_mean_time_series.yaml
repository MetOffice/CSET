title: Fog presence domain mean timeseries
description: |
  Generates a mask of whether fog is present in a grid box and provides a
  timeseries representing the chance of aviation fog anywhere within the domain.
  Here, fog is defined as when the visibility drops below 250 m (a traditional
  thickness considered by the public for fog).
