title: "Fog presence\nDifference ($BASE_MODEL - $OTHER_MODEL)"
description: |
  Generates a mask of whether fog is present in a grid box and provides
  the difference between two models. Values will be positive or negative one
  depending on which model has aviation fog present at that location if the other
  does not. Here, fog is defined as when the visibility drops below 250 m (a
  traditional thickness considered by the public for fog)
