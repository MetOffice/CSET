title: $MODEL_NAME Fog presence spatial plot
description: |
  Generates a mask of whether fog is present in a grid box and provides a
  spatial plot. Here, fog is defined as when the visibility drops below 250 m
  (a traditional thickness considered by the public for fog). A value of one
  implies fog is present; a value of zero implies fog is not present.
