title: "$MODEL_NAME Thick Fog presence spatial plot"
description: |
  Generates a mask of whether thick fog is present in a grid box and provides a
  spatial plot. A value of one implies thick fog is present; a value of zero
  implies thick fog is not present. Thick fog is defined as visibility < = 100 m.
