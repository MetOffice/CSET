title: "Snow presence\nDifference ($BASE_MODEL - $OTHER_MODEL)"
description: |
  Generates a mask of whether snow is present in a grid box. The diagnostic
  provides the difference between two models. Values will be positive or negative
  depending on which model has snow present at that location if the other
  does not.
