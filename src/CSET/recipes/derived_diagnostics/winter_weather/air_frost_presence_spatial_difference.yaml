title: "Air frost presence\nDifference ($BASE_MODEL - $OTHER_MODEL)"
description: |
  Generates a mask of whether air frost is present in a grid box and provides a
  the difference between two models. Values will be positive or negative one
  depending on which model has air frost present at that location if the other
  does not.
