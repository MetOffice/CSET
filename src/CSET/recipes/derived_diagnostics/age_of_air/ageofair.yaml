title: $MODEL_NAME Age of Air Diagnostic at $AOA_PLEV
description: |
  Extracts data required for, and calculates the age of air diagnostic on a given pressure levels. This is then plotted on a map projection for each lead-time.
  The age of air diagnostic provides a qualtitative view of how old air is within
  the domain, by calculating a back trajectory at each grid point at each lead time
  to determine when air entered through the lateral boundary. This is useful for
  diagnosing how quickly air ventilates the domain, depending on its size and the
  prevailing meteorology.
  The diagnostic uses the u, v and w components of wind, along with geopotential height to
  perform the back trajectory. Data is first regridded to 0.5 degrees.
