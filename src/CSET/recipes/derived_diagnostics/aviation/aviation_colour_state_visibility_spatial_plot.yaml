title: $MODEL_NAME aviation colour state due to visibility spatial plot
description: |
  Generates a plot of the aviation colour state due to visibility at an airfield.
  The aviation colour state can be found on the [Met Office website](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/transport/aviation/regulated/national-aviation/abs/faqs). The colours
  are more important than the values which are used to create the colourbar and
  calculate the aviation colour state. Blue represents the best conditions; Red
  represents the worst conditions.
