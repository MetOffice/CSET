title: $MODEL_NAME Aviation Fog presence spatial plot
description: |
  Generates a mask of whether aviation fog is present in a grid box and provides a
  spatial plot. Aviation fog is defined as when the visibility drops below 1 km. A value of one implies aviation fog is present (visibility is below 1km); a value of zero implies aviation fog is not present (visibility is above 1km).
