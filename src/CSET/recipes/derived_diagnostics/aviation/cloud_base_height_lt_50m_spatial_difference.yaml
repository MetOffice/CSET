title: "Cloud base height less than 50 m \nDifference ($BASE_MODEL - $OTHER_MODEL)"
description: |
  Generates a mask of whether the cloud base height is less than 50 m in a grid box and provides
  the difference between the two models. Values will either be positive or negative one
  depending on which model has cloud with a base height lower than 50 m at that location if the
  other does not.
