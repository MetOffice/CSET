title: "Aviation Fog presence\nDifference ($BASE_MODEL - $OTHER_MODEL)"
description: |
  Generates a mask of whether aviation fog is present in a grid box and provides a
  the difference between two models. Values will be positive or negative one
  depending on which model has aviation fog present at that location if the other
  does not. Aviation fog is defined as when the visibility drops below 1 km.
