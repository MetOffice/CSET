title: $MODEL_NAME Domain horizontal mean $VARNAME vertical profile as series case aggregation by hour of day
description: |
  Plots a time series of vertical profiles for the domain mean $VARNAME using a
  log pressure coordinate. Multiple cases are aggregated together keeping the
  hour of day consistent.
