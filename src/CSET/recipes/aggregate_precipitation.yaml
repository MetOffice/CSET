title: Extract sub-hourly or hourly ppn and aggregate to user defined intervals
description: |
  Extracts out the sub-hourly or hourly
  LARGE SCALE RAINFALL RATE (KG/M2/S) (stash m01s04i203) from a file
  and aggregates it up to new intervals and writes it to a new time coordinate.

steps:
  - operator: read.read_cubes

  - operator: filters.filter_cubes
    constraint:
      operator: constraints.combine_constraints
      stash_constraint:
        operator: constraints.generate_stash_constraint
        stash: m01s04i203
      cell_methods_constraint:
        operator: constraints.generate_cell_methods_constraint
        cell_methods: []

  - operator: aggregate.aggregate
    coordinate: time
    method: SUM
    interval_iso: PT2H

  - operator: plot.spatial_contour_plot

  - operator: write.write_cube_to_nc
