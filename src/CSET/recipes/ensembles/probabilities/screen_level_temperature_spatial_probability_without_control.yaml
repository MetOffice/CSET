title: $MODEL_NAME probability of temperature at screen level $CONDITION $THRESHOLD
description: |
  Calculates the probability $CONDITION $THRESHOLD for teperature at screen level
  for all members excluding the control and plots a spatial map. The diagnostic
  be used when the control is not viewed as another equally-likely member of the ensemble.
  In these situations the control is more likely than other members
  (considered by definition of how we create ensemebles) or it could be used for
  determining the impact of the control on the ensembles.
