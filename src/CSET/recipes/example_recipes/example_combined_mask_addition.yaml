title: Example adding masks for 'OR' type filters
description: |
  Generates and applies two masks, and adds them together for more complex stratified analysis.
  Examples would include masking for variables outside a range, e.g. temperature < 273 K or temperature
  > 313 K. Addition of masks would be akin to finding a probability of two events happening at the same time in different places.
