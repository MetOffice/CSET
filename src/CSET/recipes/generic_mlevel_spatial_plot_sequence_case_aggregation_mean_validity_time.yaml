title: $MODEL_NAME $VARNAME $MLEVEL Level Spatial Plot case aggregation by validity time
description: |
  Extracts ands plots the $VARNAME from a file at model level $MLEVEL. The cases
  are aggregated together by keeping the validity time consistent.

  - operator: read.read_cubes
    file_paths: $INPUT_PATHS
    constraint:
      operator: constraints.combine_constraints
      variable_constraint:

      model_level_constraint:
        operator: constraints.generate_level_constraint
