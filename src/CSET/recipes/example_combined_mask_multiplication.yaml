title: Example adding masks for 'AND' type filters
description: |
  Generates and applies two masks, and multiplies them together for more complex stratified analysis.
  Examples would include masking for temperature > 273 K and orography > 500 m. Multiplication of masks
   would be akin to finding a probability of two events happening at the same time in the same place.
