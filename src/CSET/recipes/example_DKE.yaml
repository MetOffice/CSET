title: Ensemble mean 500 hPa spatial plot of Difference Kinetic Energy
description: |
  A spatial plot of the ensemble mean Difference Kinetic Energy (DKE) at 500
  hPa. Larger DKE implies greater spread between the ensemble members, small
  DKE shows reduced spread between ensemble members. Maps of the DKE can be
  useful for identifying dynamical differences between the members and for
  deciding which processes to identify further.
