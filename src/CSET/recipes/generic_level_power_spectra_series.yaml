title: Power Spectrum $VARNAME $LEVELTYPE $LEVEL
description: |
  Extracts and plots the power spectrum of $VARNAME from a
  file at $LEVELTYPE level $LEVEL of $MODEL_NAME.

    # New operator to calculate power spectra (can try different methods)
  - operator: power_spectrum.calculate_power_spectrum
    # Plot the power spectrum but, for now, hard wire the sequence to produce power
    # spectra for every time (set sequence_coordinate to True) not averaged in any way.
  - operator: plot.plot_power_spectrum
    sequence_coordinate: True
    # stamp_coordinate and single_plot optional and only required for ensemble data
    # Leave this in for now.
    stamp_coordinate: "realization"
    single_plot: False
