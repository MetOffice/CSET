title: $MODEL_NAME Aviation colour state due to visibility spatial plot
description: |
  Generates a spatial plot of the aviation colour state using the visibility.
  The aviation colour states due to visibility can be found on the
  [Met Office website](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/transport/aviation/regulated/national-aviation/abs/faqs). This diagnostic allows understanding from a user perspective on what matters
  for aviation purposes.
