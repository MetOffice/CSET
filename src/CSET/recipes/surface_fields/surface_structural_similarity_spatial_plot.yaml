title: "$METHOD $VARNAME\nStructural Similarity between $BASE_MODEL and $OTHER_MODEL"
description: |
  Extracts $VARNAME for $BASE_MODEL and $OTHER_MODEL. These fields then have the
  structural similarity calculated between them. The $METHOD is applied to the
  structural similarity and the result is plotted as a spatial plot.

  The structural similarity often varies between +/- 1, although values can
  be outside of this range if the values are outside of
  the expected data range. Values close to 1 imply the fields are similar;
  values close to -1 imply the values are anticorrelated. Smaller values imply the
  fields differ. On maps of the structural similarity smaller, and negative values
  appear in the region where the differences occur.

  The structural similarity has been setup with a Gaussian kernel with a standard
  deviation of 1.5. This value has been chosen to mimic the perception of the
  human eye, and thus indicate differences detected at a glance.
