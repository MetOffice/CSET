title: $MODEL_NAME Domain horizontal mean $VARNAME vertical profile as series case aggregation by validity time
description: |
  Plots a time series of vertical profiles for the domain mean $VARNAME using a
  `model_level_number` coordinate. This recipe aggregates over all cases using a
  consistent validity time.
