title: $MODEL_NAME $VARNAME ${LEVELTYPE:0:1}$LEVEL spatial plot aggregation by hour of day
description: |
  Extracts ands plots the $VARNAME from $MODEL_NAME at $LEVELTYPE level $LEVEL.
  Multiple cases are aggregated together keeping the hour of day consistent.

steps:
  - operator: read.read_cubes
    constraint:
      operator: constraints.combine_constraints
      variable_constraint:
        operator: constraints.generate_var_constraint
        varname: $VARNAME
      level_constraint:
        operator: constraints.generate_level_constraint
        coordinate: $LEVELTYPE
        levels: $LEVEL

  - operator: aggregate.ensure_aggregatable_across_cases

  - operator: collapse.collapse_by_hour_of_day
    method: MEAN

  - operator: plot.spatial_contour_plot
    sequence_coordinate: hour

  - operator: write.write_cube_to_nc
