title: $VARNAME Surface Level Histogram Plot
description: |
  Extracts and plots the probability density of surface `$VARNAME`. It uses
  [`plt.hist`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html)
  to plot the probability density so that the area under the histogram
  integrates to 1. stacked is set to True so the sum of the histograms is
  normalized to 1.
