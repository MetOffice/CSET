title: $VARNAME Surface Level Histogram Plot case aggregation
description: |
  Extracts and plots the probability density of surface `$VARNAME`. It uses
  [`plt.hist`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html)
  to plot the probability density so that the area under the histogram
  integrates to 1. stacked is set to True so the sum of the histograms is
  normalized to 1. Case aggregation occurs by putting all of the data into
  one histogram whilst still providing a single cube to the histogram operator.
