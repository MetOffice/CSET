title: "$VARNAME $LEVEL domain mean time series\n Aggregation by hour of day"
description: |
  Plots a time series of the domain mean $VARNAME at $LEVELTYPE $LEVEL by averaging
  over all cases by using a consistent hour of day. For ensembles, the control
  member (assumed realization 0) is a thicker line with circles, the perturbed
  members are thinner, paler, lines of the same colour.
