title: $MODEL_NAME Domain horizontal mean $VARNAME vertical profile as series case aggregation by validity time
description: |
  Plots a time series of vertical profiles for the domain mean $VARNAME using a
  log pressure coordinate. Multiple cases are aggregated together keeping the
  validity time consistent.
