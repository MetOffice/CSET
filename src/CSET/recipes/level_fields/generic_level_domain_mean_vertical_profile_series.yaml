title: Domain mean $VARNAME vertical profile $METHOD
description: Plots the $METHOD of vertical profiles for the domain horizontal mean
  $VARNAME using a $LEVELTYPE coordinate. For ensembles, the control
  member (assumed realization 0) is a thicker line with circles, the perturbed
  members are thinner, paler, lines of the same colour.
