title: "$VARNAME $LEVEL\nMean Structural Similarity between $BASE_MODEL and $OTHER_MODEL"
description: |
  Extracts $VARNAME at $LEVELTYPE $LEVEL for $BASE_MODEL and $OTHER_MODEL.
  These fields then have the
  mean structural similarity calculated between them and plotted as a line plot.

  The structural similarity often varies between +/- 1, although values can
  be outside of this range if the values are outside of
  the expected data range. Values close to 1 imply the fields are similar;
  values close to -1 imply the values are anticorrelated. Smaller values imply the
  fields differ.

  The mean structural similarity is the mean over all windows (Gaussian kernels).
  Therefore, it is not the same as the domain mean structural similarity.

  The structural similarity has been setup with a Gaussian kernel with a standard
  deviation of 1.5. This value has been chosen to mimic the perception of the
  human eye, and thus indicate differences detected at a glance.
