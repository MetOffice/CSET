title: "Domain mean $VARNAME vertical profile\n Aggregation by lead time"
description: |
  Plots a time series of vertical profiles for the domain horizontal mean $VARNAME using a
  $LEVELTYPE coordinate. Multiple cases are aggregated together keeping the
  lead time consistent. For ensembles, the control member (assumed realization 0) is a
  thicker line with circles, the perturbed members are thinner, paler, lines of the same
  colour.
