title: $MODEL_NAME $VARNAME $PLEVEL Level Spatial Plot case aggregation by validity time
description: |
  Extracts ands plots the $PLEVELNAME from $MODEL_NAME at pressure level $PLEVEL.
  Multiple cases are aggregated together keeping the validity time consistent.

  - operator: read.read_cubes

      operator: constraints.combine_constraints
      variable_constraint:
        operator: constraints.generate_var_constraint
        varname: $VARNAME
      pressure_level_constraint:
        operator: constraints.generate_level_constraint
        coordinate: pressure
        levels: $PLEVEL
