def structural_similarity_model_comparisons(
    cubes: iris.cube.CubeList, sigma: float = 1.5, spatial_plot: bool = False
) -> iris.cube.Cube:
    r"""Calculate the structural similarity and produces a spatial plot or timeseries.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cubes: iris.cube.CubeList
        A list of exactly two cubes. One must have the cset_comparison_base
        attribute set to 1, and will be used as the base of the comparison.
        The cubes must contain a time coordinate.
    sigma: float, optional
        The standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel to be used. The default
        is set to 1.5 to mimic the human eye following [Wangetal2004]_.
    spatial_plot: bool, optional
        If set to True a 2D field of the structural similarity will be output;
        if set to False a 1D field of the mean structural similarity is output.
        Default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    iris.cube.Cube

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When the cubes are not compatible, or no time coordinate.

    Notes
    -----
    This diagnostic was introduced by Wang et al. (2004) [Wangetal2004]_. It is
    an image processing diagnostic that takes into account three factors asscoiated
    with an image: i) luminace, ii) contrast, iii) structure. In calculation terms
    it is a combination of the intensity, variance, and co-variance of an image. It is
    calculated as follows:

    .. math:: SSIM(x,y) = \frac{(2\mu_{x}\mu_{y} + C_{1})(2\sigma_{xy} + C_{2})}{(\mu^{2}_{x}\mu^{2}_{y} + C_{1})(\sigma^{2}_{x}\sigma^{2}_{y} + C_{2})}

    for images, x and y, and small constancts C1 and C2, with the other symbols having
    their usual statistical meaning.

    The diagnostic varies between positive and negative one, on the most part.
    However, should the data being compared lie outside of the specified data
    range values larger or smaller can occur. Values close to or exactly 1 imply
    a perceptably similar image; values close to or exactly -1 imply an anticorrelated
    image; small values imply the fields are perceptably different.

    The diagnostic has been setup with default values that are designed to mimic the
    human eye and so are universally applicable irrespective of model resolution.
    However, it should be noted that the mean structural similarity is not
    identical to the domain mean of the structural similarity. This difference
    occurs because the former is calculated over the mean of all the windows
    (Gaussian kernels) rather than the mean of the grid boxes.

    Further details, including caveats, can be found in Wang et al. (2004)
    [Wangetal2004]_.
