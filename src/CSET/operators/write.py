    This operator expects an iris cube object that will then be saved to disk.

    Arguments
    ---------
    cube: iris.cube.Cube | iris.cube.CubeList
        Data to save.
    filename: str, optional
        Path to save the cubes too. Defaults to the recipe title + .nc
    overwrite: bool, optional
        Whether to overwrite an existing file. If False the filename will have a
        unique suffix added. Defaults to False.

    Returns
    -------
    Cube | CubeList
        The inputted cube(list) (so further operations can be applied)
