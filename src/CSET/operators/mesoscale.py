    """Calculate a spatial perturbation field.

    Parameters
    ----------
    original_field: iris.cube.Cube
        Iris cube containing data to smooth, supporting multiple dimensions
        (at least two spatial dimensions must be supplied, i.e. 2D).
    apply_gaussian_filter: boolean, optional
        If set to True a Gaussian filter is applied; if set to False
        a Uniform filter is applied.
        Default is True.
    filter_scale: int, optional
        Scale at which to define the filter in grid boxes. If the
        filter is a Gaussian convolution this value represents the
        standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel.
        Default is 40 grid boxes.

    Returns
    -------
    pert_field: iris.cube.Cube
        An iris cube of the spatial perturbation field.

    Notes
    -----
    In mesoscale meteorology the perturbation field is more important than the
    balanced flows for process understanding. This function is designed
    to create spatial perturbation fields based on smoothing with a Gaussian
    kernel or a uniform kernel.

    The kernels are defined by the filter_scale, which for mesoscale
    perturbations should be between an approximate cloud separation distance,
    of 30 km, and synoptic scale variations (1000 km). In practice any
    value between these ranges should provided broadly consistent results (e.g.
    [Flacketal2016]_). The Gaussian kernel will give greater importance to
    areas closer to the event and will produce a smooth perturbation field.
    The uniform kernel will produce a smooth perturbation field but will not
    give local features as much prominence.

    Caution should be applied to boundaries, particularly if the domain is of
    variable resolution, as some numerical artifacts could be introduced.
