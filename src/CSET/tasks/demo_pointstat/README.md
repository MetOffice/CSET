# METplus Pointstat

You need to make a copy of the `user_system_local.conf.example` file with the
`.example` extension removed, and fill in the configuration options to suite
your local environment. Similarly the `run_metplus.sh.example` file also needs
its extension removed and the contained variables replaced.

Once these steps are done the stats can be generated with METplus.

```bash
./run_metplus.sh
```
