# CSET

CSET is a tool to aid in evaluating regional model configurations. It aims to
replace the collection of bespoke scripts littering people’s home directories,
reducing effort wasted on duplicating already existing code. This centralisation
of diagnostics should also make evaluations more consistent and comparable.
Development takes place in the CSET repository on GitHub.

Please read [the documentation](https://metoffice.github.io/CSET) to learn more
about CSET, and how to use it.

## Contributing

Contributions are readily welcomed! To get started with developing CSET visit
the [Working
Practices](https://metoffice.github.io/CSET/working-practices/#getting-started)
section of the documentation.

In addition to reading the working practices, the key
recommendation is early communication. Open an [issue on
Github](https://github.com/MetOffice/CSET/issues) with your proposed change or
addition in the design phase, and then others can provide guidance early.
