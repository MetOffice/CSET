<!-- ## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for
accepting them.
For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some
documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should
run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps
explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.
You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help
to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes
inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is
especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium
server for testing in a browser. -->
