# CSET

Convective Scale Evaluation Tool for evaluation and investigation of regional
models.

The documentation is currently hosted on the [Met Office internal
server](https://www-nwp/~jfrost/2022/CSET/docs/) and is updated whenever built
locally. This is a temporary solution, and we should figure out a better place
to host it. For those unable to view this, the built files can be downloaded
from the artifacts section of the latest [Documentation
action](https://github.com/MetOffice/CSET/actions).

Once you have the documentation, visit the [Working
Practices](https://www-nwp/~jfrost/2022/CSET/docs/working-practices/) page to
get started.
